### Yo. ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Houjun Liu ([Jemoka](https://github.com/Jemoka), [u/Jemoka](https://www.reddit.com/user/jemoka), [@Jemoka](https://twitter.com/jemokajack)). I am a student in the SF Bay Area, and I do ML and data stuff with Python, Node+front end things with JS, and occasionally C++ when I feel like it.
