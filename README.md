### Yo. Wassup? 👋 

I am **Houjun Liu** ([Jemoka](https://github.com/Jemoka), [u/Jemoka](https://www.reddit.com/user/jemoka), [@JemokaJack](https://twitter.com/jemokajack)). I am a student in the SF Bay Area, and I do ML and data stuff with Python, Node+front end things with JS, C++ (but probably Rust nowadays) when it actually matters, and Lisp (`simple but refined, guaranteed to blow your mind`). Non-Soydev with Soydevish interestes.

Here's some things I do that may interest you, in no particular order:
* ✍️ [Blag](https://github.com/jemoka/blag): My website and Blag; also secretly a [textual info extraction](https://github.com/jemoka/blagger) project. [Check it out!](https://www.jemoka.com/)
* 📋 [#!/Shabang | Condution](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/Condution): Awesome Checklist App for Humans and Aliens Alike w/ @zbuster05 @Exr0n @ban-ionic-ohms @TheEnquirer
* 📢 [TalkBank Batchalign](https://github.com/TalkBank/batchalign): Have you ever wanted your audio transcribed, utterances segmented, and morphology analyzed? Well now you can. Done at the Psycolinguistics Lab at CMU.
* 🧠 [Longitudinal NACC Data](https://github.com/Jemoka/nacc_exploration/): What happens when you have too much of very little features? Transformers go brrrrr. Done at UC Davis Engineering.
* 🗞 [ConDef/Dictembed](https://github.com/insanityhq/dictembed): Define a thing, just by context! with @zbuster05. Also [a paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-10464-0_41), you should probably ask me for a copy, though.
* 🕵️‍ [MODAP stack](https://github.com/MODAP/stack): an open-source effort to make fire detection and segmentation easier when drones arn't allowed
* 🛀 [Replier](https://github.com/jemoka/replier/): Talk with Your Transformer Buddy for Counseling. Check it out [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10661)!
* 🤖 [gregarious](https://github.com/Jemoka/gregarious): Easy-Peasy Findy of Robot-ies on Tweeties. Also [a research paper](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0214/v1). You should use [this version](https://github.com/Jemoka/gregarioussystem), which is better maintained.
* 🗣 [PolitiSort](https://github.com/PolitiSort/PolitiSort): Sort your political stance, with a little LSTM w/ @zbuster05
* 🧑‍💻 [Borg](https://github.com/Jemoka/Borg): Rapidly Configure a Lot of Things

And hey, here's a bit about me:
* 🖋 I think fountain pens are excellent
* 🛣 [Musik nonstop. Techno-pop.](http://kraftwerk.com/), baybee
* 📹 I make videos, whenever I feel like it
* 🎙 Host(ed?) a podcast with @ban-ionic-ohms. [It's kinda fun.](https://anchor.fm/yappin)
* ✅ I am seriously interested in [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and also in just being productive
* 😂 I tried to do standup. That did not go well.
