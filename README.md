### Yo. Wassup? 👋 

I am **Houjun Liu** ([Jemoka](https://github.com/Jemoka), [u/Jemoka](https://www.reddit.com/user/jemoka)). I am a student in the SF Bay Area, and I do ML and data stuff with Python, Node+front end things with JS, C++ (but probably Rust nowadays) when it actually matters, and Lisp (`simple but refined, guaranteed to blow your mind`). 

Here's some things I currently do that may interest you:
* 📢 [TalkBank Batchalign](https://github.com/TalkBank/batchalign2): Have you ever wanted your audio transcribed, utterances segmented, and morphology analyzed? Well now you can. Done at the Psycolinguistics Lab at CMU. [Read the paper](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/full/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00642) or [use the Python Package](https://github.com/talkbank/batchalign2)!
* 😤 [ASTPrompter](https://github.com/sisl/ASTPrompter) Toxicity Elicitation with Reinforcement Learning: Can you poke a LM until it goes crazy (with high probability!) with a dutch of reinforcement learing? Why yes you can! Check out [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09447) too!
* 🎤 [#!/Shabang | Simon](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon): semantic search—your data + postgres instance + 10 lines of code.
* 📕 [StanfordNLP Stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza): NLP for many human languages; I'm helping out with the model training, speed/performance optimizations, and coreference resolution!
* 🗻 [Stanford SSI Rover](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/powertron): We're sending a rover to Antartica for automatic surveying!
* 📋 [#!/Shabang | Condution](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/Condution): Awesome Checklist App for Humans and Aliens Alike w/ @zbuster05 @Exr0n @ban-ionic-ohms @TheEnquirer
* 🌲 [Plan of Thoughts](https://github.com/jemoka/sg): what if we did monte-carlo tree search to tree of thoughts?
* ✍️ [Blag](https://github.com/jemoka/blag): My website and Blag; the data from which is also driving a [textual info extraction](https://github.com/jemoka/blagger) project. [Check it out!](https://www.jemoka.com/tags/index/)

Here are some epic older projects:
* 🧠 [Longitudinal NACC Data](https://github.com/Jemoka/nacc_exploration/): What happens when you have a lot of very little features, and you are asked to accurately predict alzhimer's? Transformers go brrrrr. Done at UC Davis Engineering. Take a gander [at our paper](https://doi.org/10.1097/WAD.0000000000000619)!
* 📆 [scalandar](https://github.com/scalander/scalander): scheduling? automated. @thegail @JackHuhs @papayapaya @Jm0rr
* 🗞 [ConDef/Dictembed](https://github.com/insanityhq/dictembed): Define a thing, just by context! with @zbuster05. Also [a paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-10464-0_41), you should probably ask me for a copy, though.
* 🙊 [chat-whisper](https://github.com/talkbank/chat-whisper): End-to-end clinical disfluency analysis, but with OpenAI Whisper. Done with CMU PsyLing and the Pittsburg Supercomputer—merged into the [TalkBank Batchalign](https://github.com/TalkBank/batchalign2) project
* 🌐 these patches ([1](https://github.com/Jemoka/linux-mbp-wifi/blob/main/8004-brcmfmac-4377-chip-ids.patch), [2](https://github.com/Jemoka/linux-mbp-wifi/blob/main/9001-fix-bluetooth-shutdown.patch)) to [linux-mbp-wifi](https://github.com/Jemoka/linux-mbp-wifi): making wifi work for BCM4377 on Linux!!
* 🕵️‍ [MODAP stack](https://github.com/MODAP/stack): an open-source effort to make fire detection and segmentation easier when drones arn't allowed
* 🛀 [Replier](https://github.com/jemoka/replier/): Talk with Your Transformer Buddy for Counseling. Check it out [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10661)!
* 🤖 [gregarious](https://github.com/Jemoka/gregarious): Easy-Peasy Findy of Robot-ies on Tweeties. Also [a research paper](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0214/v1). You should use [this version](https://github.com/Jemoka/gregarioussystem), which is better maintained.
* 🗣 [PolitiSort](https://github.com/PolitiSort/PolitiSort): Sort your political stance, with a little LSTM w/ @zbuster05
* 🧑‍💻 [Borg](https://github.com/Jemoka/Borg): Rapidly Configure a Lot of Things

And hey, here's a bit about me:
* 🖋 I think fountain pens are excellent
* 🛣 [Musik nonstop. Techno-pop.](http://kraftwerk.com/), baybee
* 📹 I make videos, whenever I feel like it
* 🎙 Host(ed?) a podcast with @ban-ionic-ohms. [It's kinda fun.](https://anchor.fm/yappin)
* ✅ I am seriously interested in [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and also in just being productive
* 😂 I tried to do standup. That did not go well.
