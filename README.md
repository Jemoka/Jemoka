### Yo. Wassup? 👋 

I am **Houjun Liu** ([Jemoka](https://github.com/Jemoka), [u/Jemoka](https://www.reddit.com/user/jemoka)). I am a student in the SF Bay Area, and I do ML and data stuff with Python, Node+front end things with JS, C++ (but probably Rust nowadays) when it actually matters, and Lisp (`simple but refined, guaranteed to blow your mind`). Non-Soydev with Soydevish interestes.

Here's some things I currently do that may interest you:
