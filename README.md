### Yo. Wassup? 👋 

I am **Houjun Liu** ([Jemoka](https://github.com/Jemoka), [u/Jemoka](https://www.reddit.com/user/jemoka), [@JemokaJack](https://twitter.com/jemokajack)). I am a student in the SF Bay Area, and I do ML and data stuff with Python, Node+front end things with JS, C++ (but probably Rust nowadays) when it actually matters, and Lisp (`simple but refined, guaranteed to blow your mind`). Non-Soydev with Soydevish interestes.

Here's some things I do that may interest you, in order of how much they interest me:
* 📋 [#!/Shabang | Condution](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/Condution): Awesome Checklist App for Humans and Aliens Alike w/ @zbuster05 @Exr0n @ban-ionic-ohms @TheEnquirer
* 🛀 [Replier](https://github.com/jemoka/replier/): Talk with Your Transformer Buddy for Counseling. Check it out [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10661)!
* 🗞 [ConDef/Dictembed](https://github.com/insanityhq/dictembed): Define a thing, just by context! with @zbuster05. Paper coming, at some point :)
